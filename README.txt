Hello! 

Thank you for diving in my repository. Hope you enjoyed the journey together so far.

In this folder, you will find a .py file that you can use as a first base for your experimentation.

Feel free to download it and do whatever you want with it. 

You can also use the personalized descriptions for the agents, which you will find in another .txt document in the same folder, and should replace the "backstory" variable of all agents in Crew2, from line 76 onwards.

Here's a small list of things you should replace before running to have a good result, all of them are signaled with three hashtags (###):

POLITICS -> lines 13, 14
PHILOSOPHY -> lines 21, 22
WILL -> line 66
SPACE AND TIME -> line 66


Have fun and code rosponsibly!


V.
